📌 Why I Built This
As a self-taught full-stack developer, I built this project from scratch to sharpen my skills in creating scalable full-stack web apps. It reflects my ability to take a complete idea from frontend design to backend implementation.

✨ What Sets This Project Apart
Built 100% from scratch (no templates)
Focused on clean UI, mobile-first responsiveness, and reliable backend
Real-world functionality like JWT-based login, order tracking, and stateful cart management
