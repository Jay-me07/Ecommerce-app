📌 Why I Built This
As a self-taught developer, I created this project to prove my ability to build real, usable software solutions that solve actual problems. I challenged myself to handle both frontend and backend with full responsibility for the code, logic, and design — all with scalability and real-world integration in mind.

✨ What Sets This Project Apart
Built 100% from scratch (no templates)
Focused on clean UI, mobile-first responsiveness, and reliable backend
Real-world functionality like JWT-based login, order tracking, and stateful cart management
